Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Kowshik.

I am a Software Engineer who enjoys diving into complex domains and solving problems encompassing a wide range of elements within the software development landscape. I have multiple years of experience with JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and cloud platforms such as AWS, Digital Ocean, and Heroku. 

Recently, I collaborated with a remote team to create Most recently, I built [![Herald](https://github.com/KowshikI87/KowshikI87/blob/main/herald_icon-32x32.png) Herald](https://trellis-deployment.github.io/), an open-source observability solution for distributed applications, encompassing metrics, traces, and logs.
