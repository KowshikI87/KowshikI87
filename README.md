Hi, I am Kowshik.

I am a Software Engineer who enjoys diving into complex domains and solving problems encompassing a wide range of elements within the software development landscape. I have multiple years of experience with JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and cloud platforms such as AWS, Digital Ocean, and Heroku. 

Recently, I collaborated with a remote team to create Herald, an open-source observability solution for distributed applications, encompassing metrics, traces, and logs. Built upon the robust ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), Herald prioritizes scalability, ensuring that it accommodates a teamâ€™s growing application performance monitoring needs.
